                    <h3>Your local laws and taxes</h3>
                    <p>Take a moment to review your local laws. We want to make sure you've got everything you need to get off to a great start.</p>
                    <p>You should always educate yourself about the laws a. rules in your area before listing your space.</p>
                    <p>Many places have rules covering homesharing, and the specific codes and ordinances can appear in different locations (such as zoning, building, licensing or tax codes). Many locales require registration, a permit or a license before properties can be listd or guests can be accepted. You may also be responsible for collecting and remitting certain taxes. Short term rentals may even be prohibited altogether in some locations.</p>
                    <p>By accepting our Terms of Service and listing your space, you certify that you will follow applicable laws a. regulations, have all necessary rights to list your space, including in third party agreements like leases, and acknowledge that you have read the following notice: If you are a tenant who is listing a room, home, condominium, or apartment, please refer to your rental contract or lease, or contact your landlord, prior to listing the property to determine whether your lease or contract contains rertrictions that would limit your ability to list your room, home, condominium, or apartment. Listing your room, home, condominium, or apartment may be a violation of your lease or contract, and could result in legal action against you by your landlord, including possible eviction.</p>
                    <p>To get you started, we offer some <a href="#">helpful resources</a> under "Your City Laws." </p>
